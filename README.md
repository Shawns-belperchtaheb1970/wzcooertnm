Alright, just got out of the theater, and wow, O'Dessa. I'm still kinda ticked off at the lady behind me—crinkling her candy wrapper like she was trying out for the symphony. Not that it matters. But yeah, this film, this bizarre fever dream... it really messed with my head, you know? I mean, there’s a scene with a goat—why a goat? It’s like they threw a hipster farm into a blender with a Tarantino movie and a pinch of awkward family dinner. Boom, film!

At first, I was all like, oh great, another indie trying to out-weird the others. But then there was this... electricity? Not the literal kind, you know. The kind that makes your skin tingle and dance. It pulled me in, even when I wanted to be out. Oh, and the main character. What’s his name? Duncan? Derek? Something with a D. Dazed? Ha! That’s what he should’ve been called. Walking around like he fell through the wrong end of a metaphysical toothpaste tube.

> There’s this scene where the moon is like this giant pancake, drizzling syrupy light over the city—and I'm sitting there, half-expecting a giant fork to show up. It’s stupid, but I can't get it out of my mind. Now I want pancakes. Didn’t even plan to eat breakfast tomorrow. 

So yeah, you're watching, waiting for some grand revelation, some meaning to all this madness. Does it come? Maybe, or maybe I'm just too dense to get it—or too tired from working at the florist shop all day, breathing in pollen and small talk. Whatever. That moment when the kid starts speaking to the wind or whatever. Poetic? Profound? More like a bonkers poetry reading gone rogue. Sometimes, I wasn’t sure if I should laugh or cry, or just download the movie later and try to watch it again in a different frame of mind.

Random thought: I kinda liked the music. It was like listening to a rabbit play the banjo underwater, charming and weirdly comforting. 

```javascript
function O'Dessa'sGoat() {
    alert(Bleat!);
    return why;
}
```

But seriously, just go watch the movie. Or don’t. Maybe I’ll download it later, or maybe I’ll forget about it entirely. But in this daze, sitting here in the car, with the streetlights glowing like lazy fireflies, O'Dessa’s echo is dancing around my tired brain. And the goat. Can’t forget the goat.
